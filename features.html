            <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
            <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                will come in handy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
                    follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                    usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                </li>
                <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
                    properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
                <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
                    providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
                <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
                    design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
                </li>
            </ol>
